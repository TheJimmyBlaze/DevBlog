<h2>What is Blazor?</h2>
<p>
    Blazor lets you build interactive web UIs using C# instead of Javascript.
    Blazor apps are built using reusable web UI components implemented using C# and HTML.
    Blazor has a focus on programming with the Modular Design pattern, with an emphasis on reusability and separation of concerns.
    Both the server and client code is written in C# allowing for a common code base to be shared.
</p>
<p>
    Blazor uses Razor pages to define it's components (components being reuable UI snippets), this allows for C# to be directly interwoven into the front end code.
    A Razor page is essentially a combination of Controller and View into one file.
    Combining this with the nature of Blazors design structure empassing many small components each with their own separate concern, allows for increased productivity in my experience.
    I was able to go from nothing to website in a couple of hours.
</p>
<p>
    Blazor is a feature of ASP.NET Core, and as such leverages the dependency injection (DI) design pattern present within core to achieve built in Invesion of Control (IoC).
    My implementation was heavily relient of the DI pattern, being built in two halves:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Services:</b> providing access to the data for the website.
            Containing IO, sorting, and filtering algorithms used by the 'front end' to use in their display of UI components.
            Written in C# as typical classes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Components:</b> Individual elements of a greater UI. 
            Have a singular concern, i.e: displaying the most recent post on the index.
            Written as a Razor page, using a combination of HTML and C# (and in my case; Bootstrap).
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<br>

<h2>Blazor, and Razor</h2>
<p>
    Everything you see in Blazor is a component.
    When you create a new Blazor app using Visual Studio's Blazor project template, you will be given two namespaces: Pages, and Shared.
    Both of these namespaces contain a set of components.
</p>
<p>
    The Shared namespace contains defines the layouts which may be wrapped arround pages. 
    MainLayout.razor wraps all of the template pages with a simple navigation menu, which itself is defined within NavMenu.razor (also in the Shared namespace).
    Layouts must inherit from LayoutComponentBase, or one of its ancestors.
</p>
<p>
    The Pages namespace contains each of the pages.
    Each page is defined with a route at the top of the page, Index.razor is a little unique as it contains '/' as it's route, which as the name and route implies is the landing page.
    Each of the pages may define their own layout, but in the VS template they all make use of MainLayout.
    Pages take the place of the '@Body' tag inside of their respective layout Razor.
</p>
<p>
    Pages themselves are whoely defined in a single Razor file.
    Just as MainLayout.razor contains NavMenu.razor as a component, pages may themselves contain components.
    The VS template does not have any examples of such a page, so we will create our own.
</p>
<br>

<h2>Hello World!</h2>
<p>
    The VS template is nice and all, but there it doesn't say Hello World, which is admittedly a downside to Blazor.
    But don't worry we can fix that ourselves.
</p>
<p>
    I've created a new "Razor Component" in the Pages namespace, and named it 'HelloWorld.razor'.
    It is important to note that the quick option in VS to create a "Razor Page" doesn't not result in a "Razor Component",
    but instead an ASP Razor Page, which is not really what we want, so I went through the Add > New Item menu.
    The resulting razor looked like this:
</p>

<code>
    &lt;h3&gt;HelloWorld&lt;/h3&gt;<br>
    <br>
    @code {<br>
    <br>
    }<br>
    <br>
</code>

<p>
    Notice that it says "HelloWorld" in the header at the top of the code snippet.
    That's because that is what I named the component, if you named it something different, then it will say that instead.
    I replaced the header with: <code>&lt;h3&gt;Hello World!&lt;hr&gt;</code> which is a little more traditional.
</p>

<p>
    That's it, component is ready to use, so lets throw it in a page!
    When I said there was not "Hello World!" in the template app, that was a little cheeky, because it almost does say that.
    Index.razor says "Hello, world!", which is almost the same, but at the same time, it's not even close.
    Let's replace the templates poor attempt at Hello World! with our own implementation.
    I replaced it with the component we created above like so:
</p>

<code>
    @page "/"<br>
    <br>
    &lt;HelloWord /&gt;<br>
    <br>
    Welcome to your new app.<br>
    <br>
</code>

<p>
    If you run the app now, you can see that the index has greatly improved with a more traditional "Hello World!".
</p>

<h2>Hello World 2.0</h2>
<p>
    Although the above Hello World! is sick, it could be sicker.
    Some implementations of hello world include a textbox where the user can enter their name, and have a personalized "Hello Cam" message.
    We can do the same thing in Blazor and it's not hard.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Heads Up:</b> the VS Blazor template has Bootstrap pre installed, so I'm going to use that for the form elements.
</p>
<p>
    Heres what my HelloWorld component looked like after I added the bootstrap form elements:
</p>

<code>
    &lt;h3&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h3&gt;<br>
    <br>
    &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;label for="helloWho"&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who do hello?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/label&gt;
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;input type="text" class="form-control" id="helloWho"/&gt;<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;small class="form-text text-muted"&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personalize your Hello World message by entering your name.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/small&gt;<br>
    &lt;div&gt;<br>
    <br>
    @code {<br>
    <br>
    }<br>
    <br>
</code>

<p>
    If you were to run this component now, it would behave exactly the same as the first iteration of Hello World we implemented.
    That's because theres no logic yet. Theres nothing connected to the input, and there the word "World" is still just static html.
    In a normal web page you would connect the two with Javascript.
    But we don't want to do that, because we want the whole project to share a common code base.
    So I piped up my Hello World with C# instead using the power of Blazor, and the Razor syntax, this is what I came up with:
</p>

<code>
    &lt;h3&gt;Hello @Name!&lt;/h3&gt;<br>
    <br>
    &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;label for="helloWho"&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who do hello?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/label&gt;
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;input type="text" class="form-control" id="helloWho" @bind-value="@Name" @bind-value:event="oninput"/&gt;<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;small class="form-text text-muted"&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personalize your Hello World message by entering your name.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/small&gt;<br>
    &lt;div&gt;<br>
    <br>
    @code {<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public string Name { get; set; } = "World";
    <br>
    }<br>
    <br>
</code>

<img src="\images\posts\DevBlog\HelloWorld2.png" class="img-fluid mr-1 my-2" />

<p>
    The way this works, is that regular C# code can be written directly into the <code>@Code</code> section.
    I've added the <code>Name</code> property there.
    Properties can be directly referenced from inside the cshtml of the Razor page by adding an "@" symbol, like in <code>Hello @Name!</code>.
    This will insert the value of the Name property in place of the <code>@Name</code> tag at run time.
</p>
<p>
    I've also connected to the input to the <code>Name</code> property with a two way binding that updates onInput (when the text is modified).
    The <code>@bind-value="@Name"</code> binds the value of the input to the Name property value.
    The second part: <code>@bind-value:event="@oninput"</code> overrides the default binding update event, replacing onChanged (which requires enter to be pressed) with onInput.
</p>
<p>
    If you run the app now, the index will now have our fancy new Hello World component, and if you were to overtype the word "World" with your own name,
    a personalized Hello message would be shown just for you.
</p>
<p>
    This simple Hello World component doesn't touch on DI, or Service classes, but as I've said in a previous post, this web site still doesn't have a seach function.
    When I explain my implementation of a search feature I'll describe how I use DI and a couple of services in that post.
