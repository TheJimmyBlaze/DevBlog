<h2>Search Design</h2>
<p>
    The primary function of the search feature is to expose posts containing key word search terms.
    I have also been tagging posts with key word tags, and I wanted to expose a search for posts sharing common tags at the same time.
    And lastly, the current category browsing function only opens the first post in a given category, so I want to overhaul that system as part of this enhancement.
</p>
<p>
    With my three goals in mind, there are a few things that we will need before we can get started.
    Firstly, some service will need to exist which will allow for quickly identifying posts which match search requirements.
    Second, a set of routes allowing for a dynamic way of distinguishing search types, i.e: key word, tag, category.
    And Third, some Razor to display it all with.
</p>
<br />

<h2>Search Service</h2>
<p>
    I could build the search service by simply enumerating all posts, searching the body html for key words, but that will be very slow.
    I could instead use Elastic Search, but that requires an Elastic Compute Cluster, and I don't want to involve any external services.
    As Elastic Search is built ontop of Lucene, I could simply use that.
    Using Lucene to index the psots, and store the indexes in the wwwroot, mimics how the posts themselves are stored simply in json and html in the wwwroot directory.
    Lucene seems like a natural fit, and it just so happens that there is a <a href="https://lucenenet.apache.org/" target="_blank">.NET port</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Lucene is an Apache Foundation software, distributed as a free and open source search engine library.
    It has a bunch of cool features, but the one we need for searching the website is simply the indexing and searching functionality.
    Although lucene can be used as a 'real time' search engine, we don't really need that for our use case, and for simplicity of implementation, we only need to reindex when adding new posts.
    Because of this it may be a good idea to create a utility program which will build the indexes which the website will use to search.
    And the website can remain responsible only for searching the indexes for requested pages.
</p>
<p>
    Lucene.Net is available as a nuget package, but since Blazor is an ASP.NET Core technology, the nuget package is not fully compatible.
    This is not an issue for our use case though, as I have already tested that the nuget package will work for the functionality we require.
</p>
<p>
    More on specific Lucene implementation will follow in the next post.

<h2>Tripple Routes</h2>
<p>
    In the previous post we talked about routing a page with the <code>@page</code> tag at the top of the page.
    However, there is no limit to a single route on a razor page. You can have as many as you like.
    In our case we need 3; one for each of the three types of search.
    We will use:
    <code>@page "/search"</code>
    <code>@page "/search/tag"</code>
    <code>@page "/search/category"</code>
</p>
<p>
    There is some more utility we can derive from these routes, however.
    The search page, whichever route is used to arrive at it, still requires some term to be used to search with.
    This search term can be loaded into the route as such:
    <code>@page "/search/{SearchTerm}"</code>
    <code>@page "/search/tag/{Tag}"</code>
    <code>@page "/search/category/{Category}"</code>
</p>
<p>
    For this to work we simply need to bind the variables contained with the squiggly braces, with a property within the <code>@code</code> section of the Razor.
    I bound my routes to some properties which did a little extra work.
    I wanted the page to refresh even if the route does not change, just the property value does.
    I did this through a call to <code>OnAfterRender</code> to retrigger the loading events, like so:
</p>
<code>
    private string searchTerm;<br />
    [Parameter]<br />
    public string SearchTerm<br />
    {<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;get { return searchTerm; }<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (value == null)<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return;<br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;searchTag = null;<br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;searchTerm = value;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OnAfterRender(true);<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />
    }<br />
</code>
<br />

<h2>The Razor</h2>
<p>
    I originally planned to create a new component for displaying each of the search results.
    The new component would display the category, post title, post date, and maybe a picture.
    However, I realized that the LatestUpdate component already had all these things.
    Due to the nature of Blazor's componentized design structure I can very easily reuse this component to display each of the results.
    In addition, I want a component for the left side of the page to display a list of all of the Tags so a user can search quickly for any related tags they may want.
    So the Razor is going to need one entirely new component, and modifications to an existing component, as well as a page to put them both on, pretty simple really.
</p>
<p>
    The Tag component will need a modification to the Post service, in order to get a list of all tags on all posts.
    The Post service already has a method to get all posts, so this is simple an iterration of each post joining each of the posts, and filtering to a distinct set.
    Other than that, we can use the existing Bootstrap pill design to display then in a flex box.
    All the Tags across the whole site will need to be modified (theres only like 2 other components that display then) to provide search hyperlinks to search for the coresponding tag.
    After than this component should be completed.
</p>
<p>
    The existing LatestUpdate component is currently designed to display only the newest post on the site, and obveously the name could be confusing when reused in this new way.
    The name of the component will be switched to "PostPreview" and instead it will take a single Post's natural ID as an argument.
    This natural ID can (in the case where this component is still used to display latest updates) can be collected from a new "LatestPost" function added to the Post service.
    Other than these two modifications, the component should be ready to be reused for this application.
    The fact it can so easily be applied to an application I never indeded it for is a credit to the design patterns recommended to be used with Blazor.
</p>
<p>
    The page itself which will contain these two components is relatively simple.
    It will need a couple of loading segments, one for the Tags while they are being collected, and another for the posts, while they are being collected.
    The page itself will simply be two columns, the left for the tags, taking up 20% of the space, and the remaining 80% for the previews of the search results.
    Each of the results will be displayed in a simple distinct list with each element being a preview.
</p>
<p>
    Before we discuss the implementation futher I would like to go over Lucene, which will be used to power the search service, and is the topic of the following post.
