<h2>Search Design</h2>
<p>
    The primary function of the search feature is to expose posts containing key word search terms.
    I have also been tagging posts with key word tags, and I wanted to expose a search for posts sharing common tags at the same time.
    And lastly, the current category browsing function only opens the first post in a given category, so I want to overhaul that system as part of this enhancement.
</p>
<p>
    With my three goals in mind, there are a few things that we will need before we can get started.
    Firstly, some service will need to exist which will allow for quickly identifying posts which match search requirements.
    Second, a set of routes allowing for a dynamic way of distinguishing search types, i.e: key word, tag, category.
    And Third, some Razor to display it all with.
</p>
<br />

<h2>Search Service</h2>
<p>
    I could build the search service by simply enumerating all posts, searching the body html for key words, but that will be very slow.
    I could instead use Elastic Search, but that requires an Elastic Compute Cluster, and I don't want to involve any external services.
    As Elastic Search is built ontop of Lucene, I could simply use that.
    Using Lucene to index the psots, and store the indexes in the wwwroot, mimics how the posts themselves are stored simply in json and html in the wwwroot directory.
    Lucene seems like a natural fit, and it just so happens that there is a <a href="https://lucenenet.apache.org/" target="_blank">.NET port</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Lucene is an Apache Foundation software, distributed as a free and open source search engine library.
    It has a bunch of cool features, but the one we need for searching the website is simply the indexing and searching functionality.
    Although lucene can be used as a 'real time' search engine, we don't really need that for our use case, and for simplicity of implementation, we only need to reindex when adding new posts.
    Because of this it may be a good idea to create a utility program which will build the indexes which the website will use to search.
    And the website can remain responsible only for searching the indexes for requested pages.
</p>
<p>
    Lucene.Net is available as a nuget package, but since Blazor is an ASP.NET Core technology, the nuget package is not fully compatible.
    This is not an issue for our use case though, as I have already tested that the nuget package will work for the functionality we require.
</p>
<p>
    More on specific Lucene implementation will follow in the next post.

<h2>Tripple Routes</h2>
<p>
    In the previous post we talked about routing a page with the <code>@page</code> tag at the top of the page.
    However, there is no limit to a single route on a razor page. You can have as many as you like.
    In our case we need 3; one for each of the three types of search.
    We will use:
    <code>@page "/search"</code>
    <code>@page "/search/tag"</code>
    <code>@page "/search/category"</code>
</p>
<p>
    There is some more utility we can derive from these routes, however.
    The search page, whichever route is used to arrive at it, still requires some term to be used to search with.
    This search term can be loaded into the route as such:
    <code>@page "/search/{SearchTerm}"</code>
    <code>@page "/search/tag/{Tag}"</code>
    <code>@page "/search/category/{Category}"</code>
</p>
<p>
    For this to work we simply need to bind the variables contained with the squiggly braces, with a property within the <code>@code</code> section of the Razor.
    I bound my routes to some properties which did a little extra work.
    I wanted the page to refresh even if the route does not change, just the property value does.
    I did this through a call to <code>OnAfterRender</code> to retrigger the loading events, like so:
</p>
<code>
    private string searchTerm;<br />
    [Parameter]<br />
    public string SearchTerm<br />
    {<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;get { return searchTerm; }<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (value == null)<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return;<br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;searchTag = null;<br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;searchTerm = value;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OnAfterRender(true);<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />
    }<br />
</code>
