<h2>Jam Lite Networking</h2>
<p>
    Jam Lite is a simple TCPIP based network library designed to simplify implementation of TCPIP application development.
    Jam Lite is written in .NET targeting the .NET framework, but works fine for .NET core also.
    Data is searilized using a combination of Json Serialization from the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json/" target="_blank">nuget package</a> 
    and native .NET struct marshalling.
</p>
<p>
    Creating a networking application using Jam Lite is simple and straight forward.
    Both Jam Lite Client and Server classes have a comprehensive set of events, and are flexible enough to suit many scenarios.
    And the Jam Lite Packages used to transmit data between client and server are maluable and error resistance.
    Packages must be defined with a globally unique ID number for the purposes of serialization and deserialization of objects,
    and allows for flexible organisation of these ID numbers.
</p>
<p>
    Jam Lite is derived from an originally much more complex and feature rich library: JamLib.
    All of the additional fluff of JamLib has been stripped away from the implementation of Jam Lite,
    with a focus on portability and ease of use.
    JamLib relied on strict inheritence rules to allow for interpretation and deserialization of messages,
    but this has been refactored in to an easy to understand set of events.
</p>
<p>
    Jam Lite is thread safe and makes use of many asyncronous opperation to allow for fast and light weight communication.
    Both the Jam Lite Servers and Clients implement IDisposable and can be wrapped in a 'using' statement to ensure they are disposed of elegantly.
    Jam Lite works best in conjunction with an IoC container and the Dependency Injection design pattern,
    but is free to be implemented in which ever way is appropriate for you application.

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>
    A server is instantiated and opened to listen on a given port.
    Each client connecting to the server is given it's own thread, recorded in a Client Connection object, and is constantly pinged to detect disconnections.
    Connected clients in turn ping the server to detect detections from their end.
    The ping message can be intercepted using the 'OnMessageReceieved' event to collect latenency information on either side.
</p>
<p>
    Both Client and Client Connection objects are able to send messages between systems.
    This is done through the Send method on either side.
    Messages are sent in the form of JamPackets which must be created from a struct being marshalled into an array of bytes.
    Structs are usually stored in the JamLite.Packet.Data namespace and a few exist by default for the Ping, and Debug Message utilities.
</p>
<p>
    The Jam Packet object contains all the neccisary logic for sending and receiving messages.
    The way in which a Jam Packet knows how much data to read from a stream, and then which data to marshal back into its respective structs,
    is through the Jam Packet Header object.
    A Jam Packet Header is always of a fixed length.
    Marshalling the first few bytes of a stream read into a Jam Packet Header, will allow for the length of the trailing Jam Packet Body to be exposed.
    Once the length of the Jam Packet Body is exposed, it can simply be read and marshalled.
</p>
<p>
    In order for a Jam Packet to know how to marshal the body struct, the header must contain the unique ID number of the packet.
    If the ID numbers are not unique then there is no way for the receiving end to know how to marshal a Packet Body back into its corresponding struct object.
    The ID numbers for all struct objects are stored as constants within the structs.
</p>
<p>
    Events should be regestered against their respective MessageReceviedEvent handlers in order to properly deserialize messages.
    Each event should be listening for a specific type of message.
    For an example of this implementation, the Ping request and Response can be referenced.
